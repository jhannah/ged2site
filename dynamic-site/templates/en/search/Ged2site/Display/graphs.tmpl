		[% IF graph == 'ageatdeath' %]
			<p>
				This graph of average (mean) age at death against year of death, starting at 1840,
				only includes those who lived past the age of 20.
			</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'distcount' %]
			<p>Select an area to zoom in.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'motherchildren' %]
			<p>
				This graph depends a lot on all children being recorded.
				To make that more likely, mothers born before 1820 are not included.
			</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'ageatmarriage' %]
			<p>If the data size is not large anomolies can appear.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'familysizetime' %]
			<p>
				The time period is set by the 5 year period of the birth of the first child.
				Only 5 year periods that contain at least 5 families are shown.
			</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'infantdeaths' %]
			<p>This graph shows percentage of those born who died aged 5 or younger.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'sex' %]
			<p>This graph only includes data from 5 year periods that contain at least 25 births.</p>
			<p>Select an area to zoom in.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'firstborn' %]
			<p>This graph only includes data when the exact date of marriage and births are known.</p>
			<p>Select an area to zoom in.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'dist' %]
			<p>This graph only includes data from 5 year periods that contain at least 10 births.</p>
			<p>People who moved much further away than most (for example emigrants) are not included so that the graph more reflects the norm.</p>
			<p>Select an area to zoom in.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'ageatfirstchild' || graph == 'ageatlastchild' %]
			<p>This graph, which shows the trend of generation gaps over the years, only includes data when the year of births of parents and children are known.</p>
			<p>This graph only includes data from 5 year periods that contain at least 5 births.</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'percentagedying' %]
			<p>
				If the percentage dying looks very large, probably the number of births is low in the tree,
				so more births should be added to the tree.
			</p>
			<p>
				People with no death information born after 1920 are assumed to be alive, those born before 1920
				are assuming to be missing a death record.
				These differences could cause anomolies.
			</p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'birth_countries' %]
			<p>
				Shows the countries of birth on both sides of the family of all adults in the tree.
			<p>
		[% ELSIF graph == 'death_countries' %]
			<p>
				Shows the countries of death on both sides of the family of all adults in the tree.
			<p>
		[% ELSIF name_date %]
			<p>Show popularity of first names over the years</p>
		[% ELSIF surname_date %]
			<p>Show the popularity of surnames over the years</p>
